# Sn0wballMono
lightweight 2D game engine

# don't use this engine it's old and I hate it use the new one
[current version](https://github.com/Sn0wball-Studios/Snowball-Engine).

I do not know if this bitch compiles anymore but I'll see if I can fix that when I get home

# Features:
* C# scripting (consumes a shitload of memory lmao, does not work at all on Mono)
* scene manager
* idk what else I'm too lazy to crack this fucker open at the moment
